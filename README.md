# launchcode-javascript-class
Exercises for learning Javascript. Created for LaunchCode ReBootU Bootcamp.

If you're new to Javascript, first complete the [javascripting workshopper](http://nodeschool.io/#workshoppers) at [nodeschool.io](http://nodeschool.io/). You'll need to install [node.js](https://nodejs.org) first. You can do so using the installer at the [node.js](https://nodejs.org) site, but if you're using a Mac, we recomment first installing [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and then installing node.js via Homebrew: `brew install node`.

Then, fork this repository and check out the README in the `javascript-basics` folder.
